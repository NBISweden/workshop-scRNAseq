::: {.callout-note}
Three different toolkits, namely **Seurat** (R/RStudio), **Bioconductor** (R/RStudio) and **Scanpy** (Python/Jupyter) are available to perform the scRNAseq analysis. The labs can be run on SciLifeLab Serve or on your local machine using Docker. Both options provide the necessary environment to run the analysis.  
If you use SciLifeLab Serve, you do not need any local installation or setup on your system but you need a SciLifeLab Serve account. If you use Docker, you will need to set up and run Docker yourself.
:::


## **Option A:** Run labs on SciLifeLab Serve (Recommended)

### Steps for launching the labs 

1. Log in with your university email account to [SciLifeLab Serve](https://serve.scilifelab.se/accounts/login). 

:::{.callout-important}
This step requires that you are [registered](https://serve.scilifelab.se/signup), and your account was given access to the course materials. If you did not register yet, please follow the [precourse information](../home_precourse.qmd) and send an email to `serve@scilifelab.se` and let them know that you completed the registration.
:::

2. Select _My projects_ from the main menu. You should see a project called **SCRNASEQ_VT25**. Click _Open_.

3. In the **SCRNASEQ_VT25** project, you can create an RStudio (**Seurat**/**Bioconductor**) or JupyterLab (**Scanpy**) notebook server instance, depending on which toolkit you choose to work with. Once your instance is _Running_, connect to it.

> TODO: add screenshots/instructions on how to create a notebook server.

4. Inside the notebook server the script `download-scripts-lab.sh` is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a `labs` folder with `.qmd` files (**Seurat**/**Bioconductor**) or `.ipynb` files (**Scanpy**). In the terminal, run any of the usage examples below:
  - Seurat
  ```{bash}
  ~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "seurat" "work/labs"
  ```
  - Bioconductor
  ```{bash}
  ~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "bioc" "work/labs"
  ```
  - Scanpy
  ```{bash}
  ~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "scanpy" "work/labs"
  ```

## **Option B:** Run Docker Locally


:::{.callout-important}
These instructions are currently being updated to utilize the new containers created for the 2025 course. Instructions to use containers from the 2024 iteration of the course can be found [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-scrnaseq-2024/other/containers.html).
:::

### Local Setup

If you don't have Docker installed locally, please follow these [instructions](./docker.qmd).

### Images

Separate Docker images are made available for **Seurat**/**Bioconductor** and **Scanpy** toolkits. Below you find an overview of the available docker images. Note the space requirements!
> TODO: change image names and check how much space is needed for the individual images

|Topic|Image|Size (GB)|
|---|---|---|
|Seurat/Bioconductor|TBA|TBA|
|Scanpy|TBA|TBA|


### Seurat/Bioconductor

::: {.callout-tip}
To avoid running out of memory, restart R (_Session > Restart R_) after each lab.
:::

> TODO: update Docker command

```
cd /path/to/labs  # replace this with the full path to the workshop compiled lab folder
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq:2024-seurat-r4.3.0
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --rm -p 8788:8787 -e PASSWORD=scrnaseq -v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/workdir ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq:2024-seurat-r4.3.0
```

Do not close the terminal! In the browser, go to [localhost:8788](localhost:8788).

Inside RStudio, the script `download-scripts-lab.sh` is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a `labs` folder with `.qmd` files. In the terminal, run the command below:

- Seurat
```{bash}
~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "seurat" "work/labs"
```
- Bioconductor
```{bash}
~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "bioc" "work/labs"
```

Navigate to `/home/jovyan/work/labs/` and open the `.qmd` files.

### Scanpy

::: {.callout-tip}
To avoid running out of memory, restart the kernel (_Kernel > Restart Kernel_) after each lab.
:::

```
cd /path/to/labs  # replace this with the full path to the workshop compiled lab folder
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq:2024-scanpy-py3.10
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --rm -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home/jovyan/workdir ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq:2024-scanpy-py3.10
```

Do not close the terminal! In the browser, go to [localhost:8788](localhost:8788). Use the following credentials to log in to the RStudio Server:  

> Password: `scrnaseq`

Inside JupyterLab, the script `download-scripts-lab.sh` is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a `labs` folder with `.ipynb` files. In the terminal, run the command below:

```{bash}
~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "scanpy" "work/labs"
```

Navigate to `/home/jovyan/work/labs/` and open the `.ipynb` files.
