```

::: {.callout-note}
Three different toolkits, namely **Seurat** (R/RStudio), **Bioconductor** (R/RStudio) and **Scanpy** (Python/Jupyter) are available to perform the scRNAseq analysis. The labs can be run on SciLifeLab Serve or on your local machine using Docker. Both options provide the necessary environment to run the analysis.  
If you use SciLifeLab Serve, you do not need any local installation or setup on your system but you need a Serve account.
:::


## **Option A:** Run apps on SciLifeLab Serve (Recommended)

Instructions for using SciLifeLab Serve for this course are available [here](scilifelab-serve.html).

## **Option B:** Run Docker Locally


:::{.callout-important}
These instructions are currently being updated to utilize the new containers created for the 2025 course. Instructions to use containers from the 2024 iteration of the course can be found [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-scrnaseq-2024/other/containers.html).
