:::{.callout-note}
Three different toolkits, namely **Seurat** (R/RStudio), **Bioconductor** (R/RStudio) and **Scanpy** (Python/Jupyter) are available to perform the scRNAseq analysis. The labs can be run on SciLifeLab Serve or on your local machine using Docker. Both options provide the necessary environment to run the analysis.  
If you use SciLifeLab Serve, you do not need any local installation or setup on your system but you need a SciLifeLab Serve account. If you use Docker, you will need to set up and run Docker yourself.
:::


## **Option A:** Run labs on SciLifeLab Serve (Recommended)

1. Log in with your university email account to [SciLifeLab Serve](https://serve.scilifelab.se/accounts/login). 

:::{.callout-important}
This step requires that you are [registered](https://serve.scilifelab.se/signup), and your account was given access to the course materials. If you did not register yet, please follow the [precourse information](../home_precourse.qmd) and send an email to `serve@scilifelab.se` and let them know that you completed the registration.
:::

2. Select _My projects_ from the main menu. You should see a project called **SCRNASEQ_VT25**. Click _Open_.

![](./assets/serve_lab_project.png)

3. In the **SCRNASEQ_VT25** project, you can create an RStudio (for **Seurat**/**Bioconductor**) or JupyterLab (for **Scanpy**) notebook server instance, depending on which toolkit you choose to work with, by clicking the _Create_ button.

![](./assets/serve_lab_app_types.png)

4. You will now see a form to configure a notebook server. Under _Name_ put the name of your choice, _e.g._ the toolkit. Leave the rest of the fields unchanged. Now click _Submit_.

![](./assets/serve_lab_form.png)

5. The notebook server will now be created for you. Wait a few minutes to see the status _Running_ in green. You can now click on its name to open it in a new tab.

:::{.callout-note}
For JupyterLab you will need to use the password `scrnaseq`.

:::{.callout-note}
If the status does not turn to _Running_ within 5 minutes click on the three dots under _Actions_ and then _Delete_. Wait a few minutes until you see the status _Deleted_. Now you can refresh the page and create a new instance starting from step 3.

In rare cases it may happen that your notebook server suddenly restarts. This could be due to an error that affected the notebook globally (for example, it ran out of temporary memory). You will see this on the page where you are working. A new notebook will start for you at the same URL within a few minutes.
:::

In the case of both JupyterLab and RStudio you have access to persistent storage. This is mounted to the folder `/home/jovyan/work`. Files stored in this folder (_NB: only in this folder_) will be available even if a notebook suddenly restarts. You can also view, download these files or upload other files that will become visible in your instance through a _File Manager_ that can be launched from the bottom of the _Project_ overview page.

6. Inside the notebook server the script `download-labs.sh` is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a `labs` folder with `.qmd` files (**Seurat**/**Bioconductor**) or `.ipynb` files (**Scanpy**). In the terminal, run any of the usage examples below:
  - Seurat
  ```
  conda activate seurat
  ~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "seurat" "work/labs"
  ```
  - Bioconductor
  ```
  conda activate seurat
  ~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "bioc" "work/labs"
  ```
  - Scanpy
  ```
  conda activate scanpy
~/work/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "scanpy" "work/labs"
  ```

:::{.callout-important}
Remember that data is only saved inside the `/home/jovyan/work` folder. If you run the labs _outside_ this folder, all the labs and data files will be lost in case the JupyterLab server restarts or gets deleted (this can happen _e.g._ if it runs out of memory). It is recommended that at the end of each session you save the notebooks locally. You can do this by dowloading them through the _File Manager_ interface available at the bottom of the project dashboard.
:::

7. When you are done with a particular notebook server, you need to delete it before you can create a new one. Click on the three dots under _Actions_, and then click on _Delete_. Wait a few minutes until you see the status _Deleted_. Now you can refresh the page and start over.

## **Option B:** Run Docker Locally

### Local Setup

If you don't have Docker installed locally, please follow these [instructions](./docker.qmd).

### Images

Separate Docker images are made available for **Seurat**/**Bioconductor** and **Scanpy** toolkits. Below you find an overview of the available docker images. Note the space requirements!

|Topic|Image|Size (GB)|
|---|---|---|
| Seurat/Bioconductor | `ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq-seurat:20250320-2311` | 13.1GB |
| Scanpy | `ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq-scanpy:20250325-2256` | 16.9GB |

### Seurat/Bioconductor

::: {.callout-tip}
To avoid running out of memory, restart R (_Session > Restart R_) after each lab.
:::

```
cd /path/to/labs  # replace this with the full path to the workshop compiled lab folder
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq-seurat:20250320-2311
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --rm -p 8787:8787 -v ${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq-seurat:20250320-2311
```

Do not close the terminal! In the browser, go to [localhost:8787](localhost:8787).

Inside RStudio, the script `download-scripts-lab.sh` is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a `labs` folder with `.qmd` files. In the terminal, run the commands below:

- Seurat
```
conda activate seurat
~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "seurat" "work/labs"
```
- Bioconductor
```
conda activate seurat
~/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "bioc" "work/labs"
```

Navigate to `/home/jovyan/work/labs/` and open the `.qmd` files.

### Scanpy

::: {.callout-tip}
To avoid running out of memory, restart the kernel (_Kernel > Restart Kernel_) after each lab.
:::

```
cd /path/to/labs  # replace this with the full path to the workshop compiled lab folder
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq-scanpy:20250325-2256
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --rm -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work/work ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq-scanpy:20250325-2256
```

Do not close the terminal! In the browser, go to [localhost:8888](localhost:8888/lab). Use the following credentials to log in to the JupyterLab server:  

> Password: `scrnaseq`

Inside JupyterLab, the script `download-scripts-lab.sh` is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a `labs` folder with `.ipynb` files. In the terminal, run the commands below:

```
conda activate scanpy
~/work/download-labs.sh "https://github.com/NBISweden" "workshop-scRNAseq" "compiled/labs" "scanpy" "work/labs"
```

Navigate to `/home/jovyan/work/labs/` and open the `.ipynb` files.
