```{r}
#| echo: false
library(yaml)
library(here)
upc <- yaml::read_yaml(here("_quarto.yml"))$uppmax_compute
ups <- yaml::read_yaml(here("_quarto.yml"))$uppmax_storage
```

::: {.callout-note}
Three different toolkits, namely **Seurat** (R/RStudio), **Bioconductor** (R/RStudio) and **Scanpy** (Python/Jupyter) are available to perform the scRNAseq analysis. The labs can be run on Uppmax using Singularity (Apptainer) or on your local machine using Docker. Both options provide the necessary environment to run the analysis.  
If you use Uppmax, you do not need any local installation or setup on your system but you need an Uppmax account and become a member of the Uppmax projects. If you use Docker, you will need to set up and run Docker yourself.
:::


## **Option A:** Run Singularity on Uppmax (Recommended)

### Configure Uppmax 

#### Storage

This setup needs to be run **only once** at the beginning of the workshop. It will connect you to Uppmax and create a folder with your username in the workshop's directory.

First connect to Uppmax. Replace `<username>` with your actual user name.

```
ssh -Y <username>@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
```

Once you are connected, change into the working directory that you created in the Precourse instructions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat(paste0(
    "# change to project directory
cd /proj/", ups, "/nobackup/<username>"
))
```

Now we can fetch the scripts for the labs.

```
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/nbisweden/workshop-scRNAseq.git
cd workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs
```

Navigate to `compiled/labs/<topic>` directory to work on labs. And `<topic>` is either `seurat`, `bioc` or `scanpy`.

#### Compute

To run the labs you need to first create an *interactive session*. 

Connect to Uppmax and change into your working directory (if not already done): 

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat(paste0(
    "ssh -Y <username>@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
cd /proj/", ups, "/nobackup/<username>/workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs"
))
```

Then start an interactive session:

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat(paste0("interactive -A ", upc, " -p core -n 4 -t 08:00:00"))
```

::: {.callout-important}
Run the `interactive` command above only **ONCE** per day at the beginning of the practical session.
:::

This command will connect you to a node with 5 cores for a duration of 8 hours. You can check the *node name* under the `NODELIST` column in the output of the following command: 

```
squeue -u <username>
```

If you are disconnected from the interactive session, you can re-connect to your node with the following command:

```
ssh -Y <nodename>
```

If you get disconnected from Uppmax, reconnect to Uppmax as shown in the very first step, then check your job is running using `squeue` and login to the compute node as shown in the above step.

### Launch RStudio

::: {.callout-tip}
To avoid running out of memory, restart R (_Session > Restart R_) after each lab.
:::

#### Seurat

To launch RStudio server and run the `Seurat` labs perform the following steps:

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat(paste0(
    "cd /proj/", ups, "/nobackup/<username>/workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs/seurat
/sw/courses/scrnaseq/singularity/launch_rstudio.sh /sw/courses/scrnaseq/singularity/2024-seurat-r4.3.0.sif"
))
```

#### Bioconductor

To launch RStudio server and run the `Bioconductor` labs perform the following steps:

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat(paste0(
    "cd /proj/", ups, "/nobackup/<username>/workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs/bioc
/sw/courses/scrnaseq/singularity/launch_rstudio.sh /sw/courses/scrnaseq/singularity/2024-bioconductor-r4.3.0.sif"
))
```

### Connect to RStudio

After executing the `launch_rstudio.sh` script, a message with **your** login credentials will be printed to your screen, and it looks similar to the one below.

::: {.callout-important}
Do not close this terminal!
:::

```
        *************************************************
        *                                               *
        *  IMPORTANT: Do not close or exit this shell!  *
        *                                               *
        *************************************************

1. SSH tunnel from your workstation using the following command:

   ssh -N -L 8787:r483.uppmax.uu.se:58359 susanner@rackham3.uppmax.uu.se

   and point your web browser to http://localhost:8787

2. log in to RStudio Server using the following credentials:

   user: susanner
   password: scrnaseq

When done using RStudio Server, terminate the job by:

1. Exit the RStudio Session ("power" button in the top right corner of the RStudio window).
2. Issue the following command in both shells:

      CTRL-C
```

Follow the instructions printed on the screen to launch the RStudio Server. Open a shell *locally* and run *your* `ssh` command from step 1. Then open [localhost:8787](localhost:8787) in your web browser and log in to the RStudio Server using **your** `username` and `password` provided in step 2.

In RStudio, make sure you are in the correct working directory else set it.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| class-output: r
cat(paste0(
    "getwd()
setwd('/crex/proj/", ups, "/nobackup/<username>/workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs/<topic>')"
))
```

### Launch JupyterLab

#### Scanpy

To launch JupyterLab and run the **Scanpy** labs using Jupyter notebooks perform the following steps:

::: {.callout-tip}
To avoid running out of memory, restart the kernel (_Kernel > Restart Kernel_) after each lab.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat(paste0(
    "cd /proj/", ups, "/nobackup/<username>/workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs/scanpy
/sw/courses/scrnaseq/singularity/launch_jupyter.sh /sw/courses/scrnaseq/singularity/2024-scanpy-py3.10.sif"
))
```

### Connect to JupyterLab

After executing the `launch_jupyter.sh` script, a message with *your* login credentials will be printed to your screen, and it looks similar to the one below.

::: {.callout-important}
Do not close this terminal!
:::

```
        *************************************************
        *                                               *
        *  IMPORTANT: Do not close or exit this shell!  *
        *                                               *
        *************************************************

1. SSH tunnel from your workstation using the following command:

   ssh -N -L 8888:r483.uppmax.uu.se:34968 susanner@rackham1.uppmax.uu.se

   point your web browser to http://localhost:8888/lab

2. Log in to JupyterLab using the password:

   scrnaseq

When done using JupyterLab, terminate the job by:

1. Shut down all kernels.
2. Issue the following command in both shells:

   CTRL-C
```

Follow the instructions to launch the JupyterLab. Open a shell **locally** and run **your** `ssh` command from step 1. Then open [localhost:8888/lab](localhost:8888/lab) in your web browser and log in to the JupyterLab using the password provided in step 2.

## **Option B:** Run Docker Locally

:::{.callout-important}
The docker containers are not tested on Microsoft Windows OS.
:::

### Local Setup

Create a new directory at a suitable location. Now you can fetch the scripts for the labs. You can either download individual `.qmd` or `.ipynb` files from the [Contents](/home_contents.html) page or clone the whole repo. If you clone the repo, navigate to `compiled/labs` to work on labs.

```
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/nbisweden/workshop-scRNAseq.git
cd workshop-scRNAseq/compiled/labs
```

If the `git` command is not available, you can simply go to <https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop-scRNAseq> and download the repo as a zip file and unzip it in a suitable location.


### Images

Separate Docker images are made available for `Seurat`, `Bioconductor` and `Scanpy` toolkits. An additional set of images are available for spatial analyses. All images follow the `registry/username/image:tag` convention. The image is always `ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-scrnaseq`. Add the appropriate tag based on the lab you are running.

An overview of the available docker images. Note the space requirements.

|Topic|Image|Size (GB)|
|---|---|---|
|Seurat|`2024-seurat-r4.3.0`|8.87|
|Bioconductor|`2024-bioconductor-r4.3.0`|7.89|
|Scanpy|`2024-scanpy-py3.10`|3.68|

|Optional Topic|Image|Size (GB)|
|---|---|---|
|Seurat spatial|`2024-seurat_spatial-r4.3.0`|6.85|
|Bioconductor spatial|`2024-bioconductor_spatial-r4.3.0`|6.47|
|Scanpy spatial|`2024-scanpy_spatial-py3.10`|3.68|

### Seurat

::: {.callout-tip}

```

Do not close the terminal. At the end of the prompt, you will see a URL that starts with `http://127.0.0.1`, similar to the one below:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=0a1d9ec51b91528a1d1fe2ad2c74f59ecb94c47070c2911d
