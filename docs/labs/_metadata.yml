qc_title: "{{< fa clipboard-list >}} Quality Control"
qc_description: "Quality control of single cell RNA-Seq data. Inspection of QC metrics including number of UMIs, number of genes expressed, mitochondrial and ribosomal expression, sex and cell cycle state."

# get data
qc_data: "Get data"
qc_data_1: "In this tutorial, we will run all tutorials with a set of 8 PBMC 10x datasets from 4 covid-19 patients and 4 healthy controls, the samples have been subsampled to 1500 cells per sample. We can start by defining our paths."
qc_data_2: "With data in place, now we can start loading libraries we will use in this tutorial."
qc_data_3: "We can first load the data individually by reading directly from HDF5 file format (.h5)."


# collate
qc_collate: "Collate"
qc_collate_1: "We can now merge them objects into a single object. Each analysis workflow (Seurat, Scater, Scanpy, etc) has its own way of storing data. We will add dataset labels as **cell.ids** just in case you have overlapping barcodes between the datasets. After that we add a column **type** in the metadata to define covid and ctrl samples."
qc_collate_2: "Once you have created the merged Seurat object, the count matrices and individual count matrices and objects are not needed anymore. It is a good idea to remove them and run garbage collect to free up some memory."
qc_collate_3: "Here is how the count matrix and the metadata look like for every cell."

# calculate qc
qc_calqc: "Calculate QC"
qc_calqc_1: "Having the data in a suitable format, we can start calculating some quality metrics. We can for example calculate the percentage of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes per cell and add to the metadata. The proportion of hemoglobin genes can give an indication of red blood cell contamination, but in some tissues it can also be the case that some celltypes have higher content of hemoglobin. This will be helpful to visualize them across different metadata parameters (i.e. datasetID and chemistry version). There are several ways of doing this. The QC metrics are finally added to the metadata table."
qc_calqc_2: "Citing from Simple Single Cell workflows (Lun, McCarthy & Marioni, 2017): High proportions are indicative of poor-quality cells (Islam et al. 2014; Ilicic et al. 2016), possibly because of loss of cytoplasmic RNA from perforated cells. The reasoning is that mitochondria are larger than individual transcript molecules and less likely to escape through tears in the cell membrane."
qc_calqc_3: "Now you can see that we have additional data in the metadata slot."

# plot qc
qc_plotqc: "Plot QC"
qc_plotqc_1: "Now we can plot some of the QC variables as violin plots."
qc_plotqc_vln: "Looking at the violin plots, what do you think are appropriate cutoffs for filtering these samples" 
qc_plotqc_2: "As you can see, there is quite some difference in quality for these samples, with for instance the covid_15 and covid_16 samples having cells with fewer detected genes and more mitochondrial content. As the ribosomal proteins are highly expressed they will make up a larger proportion of the transcriptional landscape when fewer of the lowly expressed genes are detected. We can also plot the different QC-measures as scatter plots."
qc_plotqc_3: "Plot additional QC stats that we have calculated as scatter plots. How are the different measures correlated? Can you explain why?"

# filtering
qc_filter: "Filtering"
qc_filter_detect: "Detection-based filtering"
qc_filter_detect_1: "A standard approach is to filter cells with low number of reads as well as genes that are present in at least a given number of cells. Here we will only consider cells with at least 200 detected genes and genes need to be expressed in at least 3 cells. Please note that those values are highly dependent on the library preparation method used."
qc_filter_detect_3: "Extremely high number of detected genes could indicate doublets. However, depending on the cell type composition in your sample, you may have cells with higher number of genes (and also higher counts) from one cell type. In this case, we will run doublet prediction further down, so we will skip this step now, but the code below is an example of how it can be run:"
qc_filter_detect_4: "Additionally, we can also see which genes contribute the most to such reads. We can for instance plot the percentage of counts per gene."
qc_filter_detect_5: "As you can see, MALAT1 constitutes up to 30% of the UMIs from a single cell and the other top genes are mitochondrial and ribosomal genes. It is quite common that nuclear lincRNAs have correlation with quality and mitochondrial reads, so high detection of MALAT1 may be a technical issue. Let us assemble some information about such genes, which are important for quality control and downstream filtering."

qc_filter_mr: "Mito/Ribo filtering"
qc_filter_mr_1: |
  We also have quite a lot of cells with high proportion of mitochondrial and low proportion of ribosomal reads. It would be wise to remove those cells, if we have enough cells left after filtering.
  Another option would be to either remove all mitochondrial reads from the dataset and hope that the remaining genes still have enough biological signal.
  A third option would be to just regress out the `percent_mito` variable during scaling. In this case we had as much as 99.7% mitochondrial reads in some of the cells, so it is quite unlikely that there is much cell type signature left in those.
  Looking at the plots, make reasonable decisions on where to draw the cutoff. In this case, the bulk of the cells are below 20% mitochondrial reads and that will be used as a cutoff. We will also remove cells with less than 5% ribosomal reads.
qc_filter_mr_2: "As you can see, a large proportion of sample covid_15 is filtered out. Also, there is still quite a lot of variation in `percent_mito`, so it will have to be dealt with in the data analysis step. We can also notice that the `percent_ribo` are also highly variable, but that is expected since different cell types have different proportions of ribosomal content, according to their function."

qc_filter_plot: "Plot filtered QC"
qc_filter_plot_1: "Lets plot the same QC-stats once more."

qc_filter_genes: "Filter genes"
qc_filter_genes_1: "As the level of expression of mitochondrial and MALAT1 genes are judged as mainly technical, it can be wise to remove them from the dataset before any further analysis. In this case we will also remove the HB genes." 

# sex
qc_sex: "Sample sex"
qc_sex_1: "When working with human or animal samples, you should ideally constrain your experiments to a single sex to avoid including sex bias in the conclusions. However this may not always be possible. By looking at reads from chromosomeY (males) and XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) expression (mainly female) it is quite easy to determine per sample which sex it is. It can also be a good way to detect if there has been any mislabelling in which case, the sample metadata sex does not agree with the computational predictions."
qc_sex_2: "To get chromosome information for all genes, you should ideally parse the information from the gtf file that you used in the mapping pipeline as it has the exact same annotation version/gene naming. However, it may not always be available, as in this case where we have downloaded public data. R package biomaRt can be used to fetch annotation information. The code to run biomaRt is provided. As the biomart instances are quite often unresponsive, we will download and use a file that was created in advance."
qc_sex_3: "Now that we have the chromosome information, we can calculate the proportion of reads that comes from chromosome Y per cell.But first we have to remove all genes in the pseudoautosmal regions of chrY that are:

* chromosome:GRCh38:Y:10001 - 2781479 is shared with X: 10001 - 2781479 (PAR1)
* chromosome:GRCh38:Y:56887903 - 57217415 is shared with X: 155701383 - 156030895 (PAR2)
"
qc_sex_4: "Then plot XIST expression vs chrY proportion. As you can see, the samples are clearly on either side, even if some cells do not have detection of either."
qc_sex_5: "Plot as violins."
qc_sex_6: "Here, we can see clearly that we have three males and five females, can you see which samples they are? Do you think this will cause any problems for downstream analysis? Discuss with your group: what would be the best way to deal with this type of sex bias?"

# cellcycle
qc_cellcycle: "Cell cycle state"
qc_cellcycle_1: "We here perform cell cycle scoring. To score a gene list, the algorithm calculates the difference of mean expression of the given list and the mean expression of reference genes. To build the reference, the function randomly chooses a bunch of genes matching the distribution of the expression of the given list. Cell cycle scoring adds three slots in the metadata, a score for S phase, a score for G2M phase and the predicted cell cycle phase."
qc_cellcycle_2: "We can now create a violin plot for the cell cycle scores as well."
qc_cellcycle_3: "In this case it looks like we only have a few cycling cells in these datasets."

# doublet
qc_doublet: "Predict doublets"
qc_doublet_1: |
  Doublets/Multiples of cells in the same well/droplet is a common issue in scRNAseq protocols. Especially in droplet-based methods with overloading of cells. In a typical 10x experiment the proportion of doublets is linearly dependent on the amount of loaded cells. As  indicated from the Chromium user guide, doublet rates are about as follows:
  
  ![](../figs/10x_doublet_rate.png)
  
  Most doublet detectors simulates doublets by merging cell counts and predicts doublets as cells that have similar embeddings as the simulated doublets. Most such packages need an assumption about the number/proportion of expected doublets in the dataset. The data you are using is subsampled, but the original datasets contained about 5 000 cells per sample, hence we can assume that they loaded about 9 000 cells and should have a doublet rate at about 4%.

qc_doublet_2: "Ideally doublet prediction should be run on each sample separately, especially if your samples have different proportions of cell types. In this case, the data is subsampled so we have very few cells per sample and all samples are sorted PBMCs, so it is okay to run them together."
qc_doublet_3: "We should expect that two cells have more detected genes than a single cell, lets check if our predicted doublets also have more detected genes in general."
qc_doublet_4: "Now, lets remove all predicted doublets from our data."
qc_doublet_5: "To summarize, lets check how many cells we have removed per sample, we started with 1500 cells per sample. Looking back at the intitial QC plots does it make sense that some samples have much fewer cells now?"
qc_doublet_6: “In this case we ran doublet detection with all samples together since we have very small subsampled datasets. But in a real scenario it should be run one sample at a time. Why is this important do you think?”

# save data
qc_save: "Save data"
qc_save_1: "Finally, lets save the QC-filtered data for further analysis. Create output directory `data/covid/results` and save data to that folder. This will be used in downstream labs."

# DIMRED ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

dimred_title: "{{< fa brands hubspot >}} Dimensionality Reduction"
dimred_description: "Reduce high-dimensional gene expression data from individual cells into a lower-dimensional space for visualization. This lab explores PCA, tSNE and UMAP."

# prep
dimred_prep: "Data preparation"
dimred_prep_1: "First, let's load all necessary libraries and the QC-filtered dataset from the previous step."

# feature selection
dimred_fs: "Feature selection"
dimred_fs_2: "We first need to define which features/genes are important in our dataset to distinguish cell types. For this purpose, we need to find genes that are highly variable across cells, which in turn will also provide a good separation of the cell clusters."

# z-score transformation
dimred_zs: "Z-score transformation"
dimred_zs_1: "Now that the genes have been selected, we now proceed with PCA. Since each gene has a different expression level, it means that genes with higher expression values will naturally have higher variation that will be captured by PCA. This means that we need to somehow give each gene a similar weight when performing PCA (see below). The common practice is to center and scale each gene before performing PCA. This exact scaling called Z-score normalization is very useful for PCA, clustering and plotting heatmaps. Additionally, we can use regression to remove any unwanted sources of variation from the dataset, such as `cell cycle`, `sequencing depth`, `percent mitochondria` etc. This is achieved by doing a generalized linear regression using these parameters as co-variates in the model. Then the residuals of the model are taken as the *regressed data*. Although perhaps not in the best way, batch effect regression can also be done here. By default, variables are scaled in the PCA step and is not done separately. But it could be achieved by running the commands below:"

# pca
dimred_pca: "PCA"
dimred_pca_1: "Performing PCA has many useful applications and interpretations, which much depends on the data used. In the case of single-cell data, we want to segregate samples based on gene expression patterns in the data."
dimred_pca_2: "We then plot the first principal components."
dimred_pca_3: "To identify which genes (Seurat) or metadata parameters (Scater/Scran) contribute the most to each PC, one can retrieve the loading matrix information. Unfortunately, this is not implemented in Scater/Scran, so you will need to compute PCA using `logcounts`."
dimred_pca_4: "We can also plot the amount of variance explained by each PC."
dimred_pca_5: "Based on this plot, we can see that the top 8 PCs retain a lot of information, while other PCs contain progressively less. However, it is still advisable to use more PCs since they might contain information about rare cell types (such as platelets and DCs in this dataset)"
dimred_pca_6: "Have a look at the plot from `plotExplanatoryPCs` and the gene loadings plots. Do you think the top components are biologically relevant or more driven by technical noise" 

# tsne
dimred_tsne: "tSNE"
dimred_tsne_1: "We will now run [BH-tSNE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3342)."
dimred_tsne_2: "We plot the tSNE scatterplot colored by dataset. We can clearly see the effect of batches present in the dataset."

# umap
dimred_umap: "UMAP"
dimred_umap_1: "We can now run [UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426) for cell embeddings."
dimred_umap_2: "UMAP is plotted colored per dataset. Although less distinct as in the tSNE, we still see quite an effect of the different batches in the data."
dimred_umap_3: "We can now plot PCA, UMAP and tSNE side by side for comparison. Have a look at the UMAP and tSNE. What similarities/differences do you see? Can you explain the differences based on what you learned during the lecture? Also, we can conclude from the dimensionality reductions that our dataset contains a batch effect that needs to be corrected before proceeding to clustering and differential gene expression analysis."
dimred_umap_4: "We have now done Variable gene selection, PCA and UMAP with the settings we selected for you. Test a few different ways of selecting variable genes, number of PCs for UMAP and check how it influences your embedding."

dimred_zsg: "Z-scores & DR graphs"
dimred_zsg_1: "Although running a second dimensionality reduction (i.e tSNE or UMAP) on PCA would be a standard approach (because it allows higher computation efficiency), the options are actually limitless. Below we will show a couple of other common options such as running directly on the scaled data (z-scores) (which was used for PCA) or on a graph built from scaled data. We will only work with UMAPs, but the same applies for tSNE."

dimred_zsg_zs: "UMAP from z-scores"
dimred_zsg_zs_1: "To run tSNE or UMAP on the scaled data, one first needs to select the number of variables to use. This is because including dimensions that do contribute to the separation of your cell types will in the end mask those differences. Another reason for it is because running with all genes/features also will take longer or might be computationally unfeasible. Therefore we will use the scaled data of the highly variable genes."

dimred_zsg_g: "UMAP from graph"
dimred_zsg_g_1: "To run tSNE or UMAP on the a graph, we first need to build a graph from the data. In fact, both tSNE and UMAP first build a graph from the data using a specified distance matrix and then optimize the embedding. Since a graph is just a matrix containing distances from cell to cell and as such, you can run either UMAP or tSNE using any other distance metric desired. Euclidean and Correlation are usually the most commonly used."
dimred_zsg_g_2: "We can now plot the UMAP comparing both on PCA vs ScaledSata vs Graph."

dimred_plotgenes: "Genes of interest"
dimred_plotgenes_1: "Let's plot some marker genes for different cell types onto the embedding."
dimred_plotgenes_2: "Select some of your dimensionality reductions and plot some of the QC stats that were calculated in the previous lab. Can you see if some of the separation in your data is driven by quality of the cells?"

dimred_harmony: "Harmony"
dimred_harmony_1: "An alternative method for integration is Harmony, for more details on the method, please se their paper  [Nat. Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0619-0). This method runs the integration on a dimensionality reduction, in most applications the PCA. So first, we prefer to have scaling and PCA with the same set of genes that were used for the CCA integration, which we ran earlier."

dimred_scanorama: "Scanorama"
dimred_scanorama_1: "Another integration method is Scanorama (see [Nat. Biotech.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0113-3)). This method is implemented in python, but we can run it through the Reticulate package."
dimred_scanorama_2: "We will run it with the same set of variable genes, but first we have to create a list of all the objects per sample."

# save data
dimred_save: "Save data"
dimred_save_1: "We can finally save the object for use in future steps."

# INTEGRATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

int_title: "{{< fa diagram-project >}} Data Integration"
int_description: "Combining and harmonizing samples or datasets from different batches such as experiments or conditions to enable meaningful cross-sample comparisons."

int_1: |
  In this tutorial we will look at different ways of integrating multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets. We will explore a few different methods to correct for batch effects across datasets. Seurat uses the data integration method presented in Comprehensive Integration of Single Cell Data, while Scran and Scanpy use a mutual Nearest neighbour method (MNN). Below you can find a list of some methods for single data integration:

# data prep
int_prep: "Data preparation"
int_prep_1: "Let's first load necessary libraries and the data saved in the previous lab."
int_prep_2: "We split the combined object into a list, with each dataset as an element. We perform standard preprocessing (log-normalization), and identify variable features individually for each dataset based on a variance stabilizing transformation (**vst**)."
int_hvg: "Did you understand the difference between running variable gene selection per dataset and combining them vs running it on all samples together. Can you think of any situation where it would be best to run it on all samples and a situation where it should be done by batch?"

# scanorama
int_scanorama: "Scanorama"
int_scanorama_1: "Try out [Scanorama](https://github.com/brianhie/scanorama) for data integration as well. First we need to create individual AnnData objects from each of the datasets."

int_plot: "We can now plot the unintegrated and the integrated space reduced dimensions."
int_conclusion: "Look at the different integration results, which one do you think looks the best? How would you motivate selecting one method over the other? How do you think you could best evaluate if the integration worked well?"

int_save: "Let's save the integrated data for further analysis."

# CLUSTERING ------------------------------------------------------------------------#

clust_title: "{{< fa circle-nodes >}} Clustering"
clust_description: "Grouping individual cells with similar gene expression profiles to uncover distinct cell populations and their functional characteristics."

clust_1: "In this tutorial, we will continue the analysis of the integrated dataset. We will use the integrated PCA or CCA to perform the clustering. First, we will construct a $k$-nearest neighbor graph in order to perform a clustering on the graph. We will also show how to perform hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering on the selected space."
clust_2: "Let's first load all necessary libraries and also the integrated dataset from the previous step."

# graph clustering
clust_graphclust: "Graph clustering"
clust_graphclust_1: |
  The procedure of clustering on a Graph can be generalized as 3 main steps:
  \
  - Build a kNN graph from the data. \
  - Prune spurious connections from kNN graph (optional step). This is a SNN graph. \
  - Find groups of cells that maximizes the connections within the group compared other groups.

clust_graphclust_knn: "Building kNN / SNN graph"
clust_graphclust_knn_1: "The first step into graph clustering is to construct a k-nn graph, in case you don't have one. For this, we will use the PCA space. Thus, as done for dimensionality reduction, we will use ony the top *N* PCA dimensions for this purpose (the same used for computing UMAP / tSNE)."
clust_graphclust_knn_2: "We can take a look at the kNN and SNN graphs. The kNN graph is a matrix where every connection between cells is represented as $1$s. This is called a **unweighted** graph (default in Seurat). In the SNN graph on the other hand, some cell connections have more importance than others, and the graph scales from $0$ to a maximum distance (in this case $1$). Usually, the smaller the distance, the closer two points are, and stronger is their connection. This is called a **weighted** graph. Both weighted and unweighted graphs are suitable for clustering, but clustering on unweighted graphs is faster for large datasets (> 100k cells)."

clust_graphclust_graph: "Clustering on a graph"
clust_graphclust_graph_1: "Once the graph is built, we can now perform graph clustering. The clustering is done respective to a resolution which can be interpreted as how coarse you want your cluster to be. Higher resolution means higher number of clusters."
clust_graphclust_graph_2: "We can now use the `clustree` package to visualize how cells are distributed between clusters depending on resolution."

# kmeans clustering
clust_kmean: "K-means clustering"
clust_kmean_1: "K-means is a generic clustering algorithm that has been used in many application areas. In R, it can be applied via the `kmeans()` function. Typically, it is applied to a reduced dimension representation of the expression data (most often PCA, because of the interpretability of the low-dimensional distances). We need to define the number of clusters in advance. Since the results depend on the initialization of the cluster centers, it is typically recommended to run K-means with multiple starting configurations (via the `nstart` argument)."

# hierarchical clustering
clust_hier: "Hierarchical clustering"
clust_hier_dist: "Defining distance between cells"
clust_hier_dist_1: "The base R `stats` package already contains a function `dist` that calculates distances between all pairs of samples. Since we want to compute distances between samples, rather than among genes, we need to transpose the data before applying it to the `dist` function. This can be done by simply adding the transpose function `t()` to the data. The distance methods available  in `dist` are: 'euclidean', 'maximum', 'manhattan', 'canberra', 'binary' or 'minkowski'."
clust_hier_dist_2: |
  As you might have realized, correlation is not a method implemented in the `dist()` function. However, we can create our own distances and transform them to a distance object. We can first compute sample correlations using the `cor` function.

  As you already know, correlation range from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that two samples are closest, -1 indicates that two samples are the furthest and 0 is somewhat in between. This, however, creates a problem in defining distances because a distance of 0 indicates that two samples are closest, 1 indicates that two samples are the furthest and distance of -1 is not meaningful. We thus need to transform the correlations to a positive scale (a.k.a. **adjacency**):

  $$adj = \frac{1- cor}{2}$$

  Once we transformed the correlations to a 0-1 scale, we can simply convert it to a distance object using `as.dist()` function. The transformation does not need to have a maximum of 1, but it is more intuitive to have it at 1, rather than at any other number.

clust_hier_clust: "Clustering cells"
clust_hier_clust_1: "After having calculated the distances between samples, we can now proceed with the hierarchical clustering per-se. We will use the function `hclust()` for this purpose, in which we can simply run it with the distance objects created above. The methods available are: 'ward.D', 'ward.D2', 'single', 'complete', 'average', 'mcquitty', 'median' or 'centroid'. It is possible to plot the dendrogram for all cells, but this is very time consuming and we will omit for this tutorial."
clust_hier_clust_2: "Once your dendrogram is created, the next step is to define which samples belong to a particular cluster. After identifying the dendrogram, we can now literally cut the tree at a fixed threshold (with `cutree`) at different levels to define the clusters. We can either define the number of clusters or decide on a height. We can simply try different clustering levels."

clust_save: "Finally, lets save the clustered data for further analysis."

clust_distribution: "Distribution of clusters"
clust_distribution_1: "Now, we can select one of our clustering methods and compare the proportion of samples across the clusters."
clust_distribution_2: "In this case we have quite good representation of each sample in each cluster. But there are clearly some biases with more cells from one sample in some clusters and also more covid cells in some of the clusters."
clust_distribution_3: "We can also plot it in the other direction, the proportion of each cluster per sample."

clust_3: |
  By now you should know how to plot different features onto your data. Take the QC metrics that were calculated in the first exercise, that should be stored in your data object, and plot it as violin plots per cluster using the clustering method of your choice. For example, plot number of UMIS, detected genes, percent mitochondrial reads.
  Then, check carefully if there is any bias in how your data is separated by quality metrics. Could it be explained biologically, or could there be a technical bias there?


clust_4: "Some clusters that are clearly defined by higher number of genes and counts. These are either doublets or a larger celltype. And some clusters with low values on these metrics that are either low quality cells or a smaller celltype. You will have to explore these clusters in more detail to judge what you believe them to be."

clust_sub: "Subclustering of T and NK-cells"
clust_sub_1: "It is common that the subtypes of cells within a cluster is not so well separated when you have a heterogeneous dataset. In such a case it could be a good idea to run subclustering of individual celltypes. The main reason for subclustering is that the variable genes and the first principal components in the full analysis are mainly driven by differences between celltypes, while with subclustering we may detect smaller differences between subtypes within celltypes."
clust_sub_2: "So first, lets find out where our T-cell and NK-cell clusters are. We know that T-cells express CD3E, and the main subtypes are CD4 and CD8, while NK-cells express GNLY."
clust_sub_3: "Ideally we should rerun all steps of integration with that subset of cells instead of just taking the joint embedding. If you have too few cells per sample in the celltype that you want to cluster it may not be possible.
We will start with selecting a new set of genes that better reflecs the variability within this celltype"
clust_sub_4: "We clearly have a very different geneset now, so hopefully it should better capture the variability within T-cells."
clust_sub_5: "Now we have to run the full pipeline with scaling, pca, integration and clustering on this subset of cells, using the new set of variable genes" 
clust_sub_6: "Have a look at the T-cells in the umaps with all cells or only T/NK cells. What are the main differences? Do you think it improved with subclustering? Also, there are some cells in these clusters that fall far away from the rest in the UMAPs, why do you think that is?"

# DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION ---------------------------------------------------------------#

dge_title: "{{< fa chart-simple >}} Differential gene expression"
dge_description: "Identify genes that are significantly over or under-expressed between conditions in specific cell populations."

dge_1: "In this tutorial we will cover differential gene expression, which comprises an extensive range of topics and methods. In single cell, differential expresison can have multiple functionalities such as identifying marker genes for cell populations, as well as identifying differentially regulated genes across conditions (healthy vs control). We will also cover controlling batch effect in your test."
dge_2: "We can first load the data from the clustering session. Moreover, we can already decide which clustering resolution to use. First let's define using the `louvain` clustering to identifying differentially expressed genes."

# cell marker genes
dge_cmg: "Cell marker genes"
dge_cmg_1: "Let us first compute a ranking for the highly differential genes in each cluster. There are many different tests and parameters to be chosen that can be used to refine your results. When looking for marker genes, we want genes that are positively expressed in a cell type and possibly not expressed in others."
dge_cmg_2: "We can now select the top 25 overexpressed genes for plotting."
dge_cmg_3: "We can visualize them as a heatmap. Here we are selecting the top 5."
dge_cmg_4: "We can also plot a violin plot for each gene."

# dge across conditions
dge_cond: DGE across conditions
dge_cond_1: |
  The second way of computing differential expression is to answer which genes are differentially expressed within a cluster. For example, in our case we have libraries comming from patients and controls and we would like to know which genes are influenced the most in a particular cell type.
  For this end, we will first subset our data for the desired cell cluster, then change the cell identities to the variable of comparison (which now in our case is the **type**, e.g. Covid/Ctrl).
dge_cond_2: "We can now plot the expression across the **type**."

#DGE_ALL6.3:1) Are the differentially expressed genes across `type` different for each cluster, or are they all the same genes? Change the cluster to use above and check.

  You visualize your results using a simple barplot, for example:

# gsea
dge_gsea: "Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)"
dge_gsea_1: "Besides the enrichment using hypergeometric test, we can also perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which scores ranked genes list (usually based on fold changes) and computes permutation test to check if a particular gene set is more present in the Up-regulated genes, among the DOWN_regulated genes or not differentially regulated."
dge_gsea_2: "Once our list of genes are sorted, we can proceed with the enrichment itself. We can use the package to get gene set from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) and select KEGG pathways as an example."
dge_gsea_3: "Next, we will run GSEA. This will result in a table containing information for several pathways. We can then sort and filter those pathways to visualize only the top ones. You can select/filter them by either `p-value` or normalized enrichment score (`NES`)."
dge_gsea_4: "Which KEGG pathways are upregulated in this cluster? Which KEGG pathways are dowregulated in this cluster? Change the pathway source to another gene set (e.g. CP:WIKIPATHWAYS or CP:REACTOME or CP:BIOCARTA or GO:BP) and check the if you get similar results?"
dge_save: "Finally, let's save the integrated data for further analysis."

# CELLTYPE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

ct_title: "{{< fa bacterium >}} Celltype prediction"
ct_description: "Assignment of cell identities based on gene expression patterns using reference data."

ct_1: |
  Celltype prediction can either be performed on indiviudal cells where each cell gets a predicted celltype label, or on the level of clusters. All methods are based on similarity to other datasets, single cell or sorted bulk RNAseq, or uses known marker genes for each cell type.

  Ideally celltype predictions should be run on each sample separately and not using the integrated data. In this case we will select one sample from the Covid data, `ctrl_13` and predict celltype by cell on that sample.

  Some methods will predict a celltype to each cell based on what it is most similar to, even if that celltype is not included in the reference. Other methods include an uncertainty so that cells with low similarity scores will be unclassified.

  There are multiple different methods to predict celltypes, here we will just cover a few of those. 
ct_2: "We will use a reference PBMC dataset from the `scPred` package which is provided as a Seurat object with counts. And we will test classification based on the `scPred` and `scMap` methods. Finally we will use gene set enrichment predict celltype based on the DEGs of each cluster."
ct_seurat_2: "We will use a reference PBMC dataset from the `scPred` package which is provided as a Seurat object with counts. Unfortunately scPred has not been updated to run with Seurat v5, so we will not use it here. We will test classification based on Seurat `labelTransfer`, the `SingleR` method `scPred` and using `Azimuth`. Finally we will use gene set enrichment predict celltype based on the DEGs of each cluster."

# read data
ct_read: "Read data"
ct_read_1: "First, lets load required libraries"
ct_read_2: "Let's read in the saved Covid-19 data object from the clustering step."
ct_read_3: "Subset one patient."

# prepare reference data
ct_ref: "Reference data"
ct_ref_1: "Load the reference dataset with annotated labels that is provided by the `scPred` package, it is a subsampled set of cells from human PBMCs."
ct_ref_2: "Rerun analysis pipeline. Run normalization, feature selection and dimensionality reduction"
ct_ref_3: "Run all steps of the analysis for the **ctrl** sample as well. Use the clustering from the integration lab with resolution 0.5."

# scpred
ct_scpred: scPred
ct_scpred_1: "scPred will train a classifier based on all principal components. First, `getFeatureSpace()` will create a scPred object stored in the `@misc` slot where it extracts the PCs that best separates the different celltypes. Then `trainModel()` will do the actual training for each celltype."
ct_scpred_2: "We can then print how well the training worked for the different celltypes by printing the number of PCs used, the ROC value and Sensitivity/Specificity. Which celltypes do you think are harder to classify based on this dataset?"
ct_scpred_3: |
  You can optimize parameters for each dataset by chaining parameters and testing different types of models, see more at: <https://powellgenomicslab.github.io/scPred/articles/introduction.html>. But for now, we will continue with this model.
  Now, let's predict celltypes on our data, where scPred will align the two datasets with Harmony and then perform classification.
ct_scpred_4: "Now plot how many	cells of each celltypes	can be found in	each cluster."

# SingleR
ct_singler: SinlgeR
ct_singler_1: "SingleR is performs unbiased cell type recognition from single-cell RNA sequencing data, by leveraging reference transcriptomic datasets of pure cell types to infer the cell of origin of each single cell independently."
ct_singler_2: "There are multiple datasets included in the `celldex` package that can be used for celltype prediction, here we will test two different ones, the `DatabaseImmuneCellExpressionData` and the `HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData`. In addition we will use the same reference dataset that we used for label transfer above but using SingleR instead."

ct_azimuth: "Azimuth"
ct_azimuth_1: "There are multiple online resources with large curated datasets with methods to integrate and do label transfer. One such resource is [Azimuth](https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/) another one is [Disco](https://www.immunesinglecell.org/)."
#ct_azimuth_2: "Azimuth is also possible to install and run locally, but in this case we have used the online app and ran the predictions for you. So you just have to download the prediction file."
ct_azimuth_2: "Here we will use the PBMC reference provided with Azimuth. Which in principle runs label transfer of your dataset onto a large curated reference. The first time you run the command, the `pbmcref` dataset will be downloaded to your local computer." 

ct_compare: "Compare results"
ct_compare_1: "Now we will compare the output of the two methods using the convenient function in scPred `crossTab()` that prints the overlap between two metadata slots."
ct_compare_2: "We can also plot all the different predictions side by side"
ct_compare_3: "As you can see, the predictions are fairly similar, but there are some minor differences, especially in the NK/T-cell group. Depending on the type of tissue you are working with and the availability for reference data, different methods may be best for your case."

ct_gsea: "GSEA with celltype markers"
ct_gsea_1: |
  Another option, where celltype can be classified on cluster level is to use gene set enrichment among the DEGs with known markers for different celltypes. Similar to how we did functional enrichment for the DEGs in the differential expression exercise. 
  There are some resources for celltype gene sets that can be used. Such as [CellMarker](http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker/), [PanglaoDB](https://panglaodb.se/) or celltype gene sets at [MSigDB](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp).
  We can also look at overlap between DEGs in a reference dataset and the dataset you are analyzing. 

ct_gsea_deg: "DEG overlap"
ct_gsea_deg_1: "First, lets extract top DEGs for our Covid-19 dataset and the reference dataset. When we run differential expression for our dataset, we want to report as many genes as possible, hence we set the cutoffs quite lenient."
ct_gsea_deg_2: "Now we can run GSEA for the DEGs from our dataset and check for enrichment of top DEGs in the reference dataset."
ct_gsea_deg_3: |
  Selecting top significant overlap per cluster, we can now rename the clusters according to the predicted labels. OBS! Be aware that if you have some clusters that have non-significant p-values for all the gene sets, the cluster label will not be very reliable. Also, the gene sets you are using may not cover all the celltypes you have in your dataset and hence predictions may just be the most similar celltype.
  Also, some of the clusters have very similar p-values to multiple celltypes, for instance the ncMono and cMono celltypes are equally good for some clusters.
ct_gsea_deg_4: "Compare the results with the other celltype prediction methods in the **ctrl_13** sample."

ct_gsea_annot: "With annotated gene sets"
ct_gsea_annot_1: "We have downloaded the celltype gene lists from http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker/CellMarker_download.html and converted the excel file to a csv for you. Read in the gene lists and do some filtering."
ct_gsea_annot_2: "Do you think that the methods overlap well? Where do you see the most inconsistencies?"
ct_gsea_annot_3: "In this case we do not have any ground truth, and we cannot say which method performs best. You should keep in mind, that any celltype classification method is just a prediction, and you still need to use your common sense and knowledge of the biological system to judge if the results make sense."

ct_save: "Finally, lets save the data with predictions."

# SPATIAL --------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

st_title: "{{< fa microscope >}} Spatial Transcriptomics"
st_description: "Combining single-cell gene expression data with spatial information to reveal the spatial distribution of gene activity within tissues."

st_1: |
  Spatial transcriptomic data with the Visium platform is in many ways similar to scRNAseq data. It contains UMI counts for 5-20 cells instead of single cells, but is still quite sparse in the same way as scRNAseq data is, but with the additional information about spatial location in the tissue.

  Here we will first run quality control in a similar manner to scRNAseq data, then QC filtering, dimensionality reduction, integration and clustering. Then we will use scRNAseq data from mouse cortex to run label transfer to predict celltypes in the Visium spots.

  We will use two **Visium** spatial transcriptomics dataset of the mouse brain (Sagittal), which are publicly available from the [10x genomics website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets/). Note, that these dataset have already been filtered for spots that does not overlap with the tissue.

# preparation
st_prep: "Preparation"
st_prep_1: "Load packages"
st_prep_2: "Load ST data"

# quality control
st_qc: "Quality control"
st_qc_1: "Similar to scRNA-seq we use statistics on number of counts, number of features and percent mitochondria for quality control. "
st_qc_2: "We can also plot the same data onto the tissue section."
st_qc_3: |
  As you can see, the spots with low number of counts/features and high mitochondrial content are mainly towards the edges of the tissue. It is quite likely that these regions are damaged tissue. You may also see regions within a tissue with low quality if you have tears or folds in your section. 
  
  But remember, for some tissue types, the amount of genes expressed and proportion mitochondria may also be a biological features, so bear in mind what tissue you are working on and what these features mean.

st_qc_filter: "Filter spots"
st_qc_filter_1: "Select all spots with less than **25%** mitocondrial reads, less than **20%** hb-reads and **500** detected genes. You must judge for yourself based on your knowledge of the tissue what are appropriate filtering criteria for your dataset."

st_qc_top: "Top expressed genes"
st_qc_top_1: "As for scRNA-seq data, we will look at what the top expressed genes are."
st_qc_top_2: "As you can see, the mitochondrial genes are among the top expressed genes. Also the lncRNA gene Bc1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1). Also one hemoglobin gene."

st_qc_filterg: "Filter genes"
st_qc_filterg_1: "We will remove the *Bc1* gene, hemoglobin genes (blood contamination) and the mitochondrial genes."

# analysis
st_analysis: "Analysis"
st_analysis_1: "We will proceed with the data in a very similar manner to scRNA-seq data."
st_analysis_2: "Now we can plot gene expression of individual genes, the gene *Hpca* is a strong hippocampal marker and *Ttr* is a marker of the choroid plexus."

st_analysis_dimred: "Dimensionality reduction and clustering"
st_analysis_dimred_1: "We can then now run dimensionality reduction and clustering using the same workflow as we use for scRNA-seq analysis. "
st_analysis_dimred_2: "We can then plot clusters onto umap or onto the tissue section."

st_analysis_int: "Integration"
st_analysis_int_1: "Quite often, there are strong batch effects between different ST sections, so it may be a good idea to integrate the data across sections."
st_analysis_int_2: "Then we run dimensionality reduction and clustering as before."
st_analysis_int_3: "Do you see any differences between the integrated and non-integrated clustering? Judge for yourself, which of the clusterings do you think looks best? As a reference, you can compare to brain regions in the [Allen brain atlas](https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/thumbnails/100042147?image_type=atlas)."

st_analysis_svg: "Spatially Variable Features"
st_analysis_svg_1: |
  There are two main workflows to identify molecular features that correlate with spatial location within a tissue. The first is to perform differential expression based on spatially distinct clusters, the other is to find features that have spatial patterning without taking clusters or spatial annotation into account. 
  First, we will do differential expression between clusters just as we did for the scRNAseq data before.

# single cell data
st_ss: "Single cell data"
st_ss_1: "We can use a scRNA-seq dataset as a reference to predict the proportion of different celltypes in the Visium spots. Keep in mind that it is important to have a reference that contains all the celltypes you expect to find in your spots. Ideally it should be a scRNA-seq reference from the exact same tissue. We will use a reference scRNA-seq dataset of ~14,000 adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy from the Allen Institute, generated with the SMART-Seq2 protocol."
st_ss_2: "For speed, and for a more fair comparison of the celltypes, we will subsample all celltypes to a maximum of 200 cells per class (`subclass`)."

# subset st
st_sub: "Subset ST for cortex"
st_sub_1: "Since the scRNAseq dataset was generated from the mouse cortex, we will subset the visium dataset in order to select mainly the spots part of the cortex. Note that the integration can also be performed on the whole brain slice, but it would give rise to false positive cell type assignments and therefore it should be interpreted with more care."

# deconvolution
st_deconv: "Deconvolution"
st_deconv_1: "Deconvolution is a method to estimate the abundance (or proportion) of different celltypes in a bulkRNAseq dataset using a single cell reference. As the Visium data can be seen as a small bulk, we can both use methods for traditional bulkRNAseq as well as methods especially developed for Visium data. Some methods for deconvolution are DWLS, cell2location, Tangram, Stereoscope, RCTD, SCDC and many more."

st_deconv_genes: "Select genes for deconvolution"
st_deconv_genes_1: |
  Most deconvolution methods does a prior gene selection and there are different options that are used:
  - Use variable genes in the SC data.
  - Use variable genes in both SC and ST data
  - DE genes between clusters in the SC data.
  
  In this case we will use top DE genes per cluster, so first we have to run DGE detection on the scRNAseq data.

st_2: "Keep in mind that the deconvolution results are just predictions, depending on how well your scRNAseq data covers the celltypes that are present in the ST data and on how parameters, gene selection etc. are tuned you may get different results."
st_3: "Subset for another region that does not contain cortex cells and check what you get from the label transfer. Suggested region is the right end of the posterial section that you can select like this:"
