We advocate that we should fully embrace the features of single cell data, which allows us to observe binary (from Off to On) as well as continuous (the amount of expression) regulations. Wu et al. (2018)\n\n\nBut single cell expression looks more like this. With lots of zeros. Now, it’s harder to say if the difference is significant. Apart from the level of expression, the number of samples (cells) that express the gene also becomes relevant. If we only look at expression level, they might be similar, but if we look at number of cells, one might be higher than the other."

We do accept application from other countries, but priority is given to applicants from Swedish universities prior to applicants from industry and academics from other countries.\n\nPlease note that NBIS training events do not provide any formal university credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before submitting a workshop application in order to establish whether the workshop is valid for formal credits or not.\n\nWe cannot invoice private individuals, therefore an affiliation is required.\n\n\n\nPractical exercises can be performed using R or Python, so we only accept students with previous experience in one of those programming languages.\n\nBasic knowledge in R/Python and command line (bash).\nBe able to use your own computer with R or Python installed for the practical computational exercises. Instructions on installation will be sent by email to accepted participants.\nProgramming/scripting experience is required (in R or python).\nBasic understanding of NGS technologies and RNA-sequencing data.\nDesirable: Previous experience with RNA-seq analysis and/or participation in NGS/RNA-seq workshop is an advantage.\n\nDue to limited space the workshop can accommodate maximum of 25 participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the workshop as well as gender and geographical balance."

These cells consist of lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells), monocytes and dendritic cells, whereas erythrocytes and platelets have no nuclei, and granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) have multi-lobed nuclei.\nData was downloaded from GEO GSE149689 entry. For the tutorials we have selected 4 of the severe patients and 4 controls from that dataset. Each donor was then downsampled to 1500 cells per individual just to speed up the processing times in the labs. The script used to select samples and downsampling can be found in our GitHub repo."

The dataset we are using is an integrated object with bone marrow data from multiple studies.\nThe data was integrated with Harmony and saved as a Seurat object. We already have subsetted the dataset (with 6688 cells and 3585 genes). In addition there was some manual filtering done to remove clusters that are disconnected and cells that are hard to cluster, which can be seen in this script"
