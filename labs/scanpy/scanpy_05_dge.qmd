Differential expression is performed with the function rank_genes_group. The default method to compute differential expression is the
t-test_overestim_var. Other implemented methods are: logreg, t-test and wilcoxon.

By default, the .raw attribute of AnnData is used in case it has been initialized, it can be changed by setting use_raw=False.

The clustering with resolution 0.6 seems to give a reasonable number of clusters, so we will use that clustering for all DE tests.

First, let's import libraries and fetch the clustered data from the previous lab.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scanpy as sc
import gseapy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
import os
import urllib.request

warnings.simplefilter(action="ignore", category=Warning)

# verbosity: errors (0), warnings (1), info (2), hints (3)
sc.settings.verbosity = 2

sc.settings.set_figure_params(dpi=80)
```

Read in the clustered data object.

```{python}
# download pre-computed data if missing or long compute
fetch_data = True

# url for source and intermediate data
path_data = "https://export.uppmax.uu.se/naiss2023-23-3/workshops/workshop-scrnaseq"

path_results = "data/covid/results"
if not os.path.exists(path_results):
    os.makedirs(path_results, exist_ok=True)

# path_file = "data/covid/results/scanpy_covid_qc_dr_scanorama_cl.h5ad"
path_file = "data/covid/results/scanpy_covid_qc_dr_scanorama_cl.h5ad"
if fetch_data and not os.path.exists(path_file):
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(os.path.join(
        path_data, 'covid/results/scanpy_covid_qc_dr_scanorama_cl.h5ad'), path_file)

adata = sc.read_h5ad(path_file)
adata
```

```{python}
print(adata.X.shape)
print(adata.raw.X.shape)
print(adata.raw.X[:10,:10])
```

As you can see, the X matrix only contains the variable genes, while the raw matrix contains all genes.

Printing a few of the values in adata.raw.X shows that the raw matrix is normalized.

For DGE analysis we would like to run with all genes, on normalized values, so we will have to revert back to the raw matrix. In case you have raw counts in the matrix you also have to renormalize and logtransform.

```{python}
adata = adata.raw.to_adata()
```

Now lets look at the clustering of the object we loaded in the umap. We will use louvain_0.6 clustering in this exercise.

```{python}
sc.pl.umap(adata, color='louvain_0.6')
```

## T-test

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain_0.6', method='t-test', key_added = "t-test")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key = "t-test")

# results are stored in the adata.uns["t-test"] slot
adata
```

## T-test overestimated_variance

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain_0.6', method='t-test_overestim_var', key_added = "t-test_ov")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key = "t-test_ov")
```

## Wilcoxon rank-sum

The result of a Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney-U) test is very similar. We recommend using the latter in publications, see e.g., Sonison & Robinson (2018). You might also consider much more powerful differential testing packages like MAST, limma, DESeq2 and, for python, the recent diffxpy.

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain_0.6', method='wilcoxon', key_added = "wilcoxon")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key="wilcoxon")
```

## Logistic regression test

As an alternative, let us rank genes using logistic regression. For instance, this has been suggested by Natranos et al. (2018). The essential difference is that here, we use a multi-variate appraoch whereas conventional differential tests are uni-variate. Clark et al. (2014) has more details.

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain_0.6', method='logreg',key_added = "logreg")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key = "logreg")
```

## Compare genes

Take all significant DE genes for cluster0 with each test and compare the overlap.

```{python}
#compare cluster1 genes, only stores top 100 by default

wc = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, group='0', key='wilcoxon', pval_cutoff=0.01, log2fc_min=0)['names']
tt = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, group='0', key='t-test', pval_cutoff=0.01, log2fc_min=0)['names']
tt_ov = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, group='0', key='t-test_ov', pval_cutoff=0.01, log2fc_min=0)['names']

from matplotlib_venn import venn3

venn3([set(wc),set(tt),set(tt_ov)], ('Wilcox','T-test','T-test_ov') )
plt.show()
```

As you can see, the Wilcoxon test and the T-test with overestimated variance gives very similar result. Also the regular T-test has good overlap.

## Visualization

There are several ways to visualize the expression of top DE genes. Here we will plot top 5 genes per cluster from Wilcoxon test as heatmap, dotplot, violin plot or matrix.

```{python}
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap(adata, n_genes=5, key="wilcoxon", groupby="louvain_0.6", show_gene_labels=True)
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(adata, n_genes=5, key="wilcoxon", groupby="louvain_0.6")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_stacked_violin(adata, n_genes=5, key="wilcoxon", groupby="louvain_0.6")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_matrixplot(adata, n_genes=5, key="wilcoxon", groupby="louvain_0.6")
```

## Compare specific clusters

We can also do pairwise comparisons of individual clusters on one vs many clusters. For instance, clusters 1 & 2 have very similar expression profiles.

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'louvain_0.6', groups=['1'], reference='2', method='wilcoxon')
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata, groups=['1'], n_genes=20)
```

Plot as violins for those two groups.

```{python}
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_violin(adata, groups='1', n_genes=10)

# plot the same genes as violins across all the datasets.

# convert numpy.recarray to list
mynames = [x[0] for x in adata.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names'][:10]]
sc.pl.stacked_violin(adata, mynames, groupby = 'louvain_0.6')
```

## {{< meta dge_cond >}}

{{< meta dge_cond_1 >}}

```{python}
cl1 = adata[adata.obs['louvain_0.6'] == '4',:]
cl1.obs['type'].value_counts()

sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(cl1, 'type', method='wilcoxon', key_added = "wilcoxon")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(cl1, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key="wilcoxon")
```

```{python}
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_violin(cl1, n_genes=10, key="wilcoxon")
```

We can also plot these genes across all clusters, but split by "type", to check if the genes are also up/downregulated in other celltypes.

```{python}
import seaborn as sns

genes1 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1, group='Covid', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:5]
genes2 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1, group='Ctrl', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:5]
genes = genes1.tolist() +  genes2.tolist() 
df = sc.get.obs_df(adata, genes + ['louvain_0.6','type'], use_raw=False)
df2 = df.melt(id_vars=["louvain_0.6",'type'], value_vars=genes)

sns.catplot(x = "louvain_0.6", y = "value", hue = "type", kind = 'violin', col = "variable", data = df2, col_wrap=4, inner=None)
```

As you can see, we have many sex chromosome related genes among the top DE genes. And if you remember from the QC lab, we have inbalanced sex distribution among our subjects, so this may not be related to covid at all.

### Remove sex chromosome genes

To remove some of the bias due to inbalanced sex in the subjects we can remove the sex chromosome related genes.

```{python}
annot = sc.queries.biomart_annotations(
        "hsapiens",
        ["ensembl_gene_id", "external_gene_name", "start_position", "end_position", "chromosome_name"],
    ).set_index("external_gene_name")

chrY_genes = adata.var_names.intersection(annot.index[annot.chromosome_name == "Y"])
chrX_genes = adata.var_names.intersection(annot.index[annot.chromosome_name == "X"])

sex_genes = chrY_genes.union(chrX_genes)
print(len(sex_genes))
all_genes = cl1.var.index.tolist()
print(len(all_genes))

keep_genes = [x for x in all_genes if x not in sex_genes]
print(len(keep_genes))

cl1 = cl1[:,keep_genes]
```

Rerun differential expression.

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(cl1, 'type', method='wilcoxon', key_added = "wilcoxon")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(cl1, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key="wilcoxon")
```

### Patient batch effects

When we are testing for Covid vs Control we are running a DGE test for 3 vs 3 individuals. That will be very sensitive to sample differences unless we find a way to control for it. So first, lets check how the top DGEs are expressed across the individuals:

```{python}
genes1 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1, group='Covid', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:5]
genes2 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1, group='Ctrl', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:5]
genes = genes1.tolist() +  genes2.tolist() 

sc.pl.violin(cl1, genes1, groupby='sample')
sc.pl.violin(cl1, genes2, groupby='sample')
```

As you can see, many of the genes detected as DGE in Covid are unique to one or 2 patients.

We can also plot the top Covid and top Ctrl genes as a dotplot:

```{python}
genes1 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1, group='Covid', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:20]
genes2 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1, group='Ctrl', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:20]
genes = genes1.tolist() +  genes2.tolist() 

sc.pl.dotplot(cl1,genes, groupby='sample')
```

Clearly many of the top Covid genes are only high in the covid_17 sample, and not a general feature of covid patients.

This is also the patient with the highest number of cells in this cluster:

```{python}
cl1.obs['sample'].value_counts()
```

### Subsample

So one obvious thing to consider is an equal amount of cells per individual so that the DGE results are not dominated by a single sample.

So we will downsample to an equal number of cells per sample, in this case 34 cells per sample as it is the lowest number among all samples


```{python}
target_cells = 37

tmp = [cl1[cl1.obs['sample'] == s] for s in cl1.obs['sample'].cat.categories]

for dat in tmp:
    if dat.n_obs > target_cells:
            sc.pp.subsample(dat, n_obs=target_cells)

cl1_sub = tmp[0].concatenate(*tmp[1:])

cl1_sub.obs['sample'].value_counts()
```

```{python}
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(cl1_sub, 'type', method='wilcoxon', key_added = "wilcoxon")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(cl1_sub, n_genes=25, sharey=False, key="wilcoxon")
```

```{python}
genes1 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1_sub, group='Covid', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:20]
genes2 = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1_sub, group='Ctrl', key='wilcoxon')['names'][:20]
genes = genes1.tolist() +  genes2.tolist() 

sc.pl.dotplot(cl1,genes, groupby='sample')
```

It looks much better now. But if we look per patient you can see that we still have some genes that are dominated by a single patient. Still, it is often a good idea to control the number of cells from each sample when doing differential expression.

There are many different ways to try and resolve the issue of patient batch effects, however most of them require R packages. These can be run via rpy2 as is demonstraded in this compendium:
https://www.sc-best-practices.org/conditions/differential_gene_expression.html

However, we have not included it here as of now. So please have a look at the patient batch effect section in the seurat DGE tutorial where we run EdgeR on pseudobulk and MAST with random effect.

We need a table with all DEGs and their log foldchanges. However, many lowly expressed genes will have high foldchanges and just contribue noise, so also filter for expression in enough cells.

```{python}
gene_rank = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(cl1_sub, group='Covid', key='wilcoxon')[['names','logfoldchanges']]
gene_rank.sort_values(by=['logfoldchanges'], inplace=True, ascending=False)

# calculate_qc_metrics will calculate number of cells per gene
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(cl1, percent_top=None, log1p=False, inplace=True)

# filter for genes expressed in at least 30 cells.
gene_rank = gene_rank[gene_rank['names'].isin(cl1.var_names[cl1.var.n_cells_by_counts>30])]

gene_rank
