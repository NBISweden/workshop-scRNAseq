## Workflow

- Quality control
- Cell cycle phase classification
- Normalization
- Select highly variable genes
- Data integration
- Clustering
- Cell typing
- Differential gene expression
- **Functional analysis (GSA/GSEA)**

## Many names for functional analysis

- Functional analysis
- Pathway analysis
- Gene set analyses (GSA)
- Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
- Gene list enrichment analysis
- Go term analysis
- Over representation analysis
- Hypergeometric test

...

## What is functional analysis?

![](assets/functional.png)

. . .

Gene-level data -> Gene set data

. . .

We focus on transcriptiomics and DGE, but in principle applies to any genome-wide data

:::{.notes}
Many different kinds of genome wide analyses such differential gene expression, differential binding (chip-seq), differential methylation etc. could all end up here at functional analysis.

## Why functional analysis?

- Make sense of long list of DEGs
- What is the function of those genes?
- What is the biological consequence of over/under expression of genes?
- Connect your DEGs and thereby your experiment to pathway activity
- Top genes in itself might be be the most interesting inference
- Less prone to false positive DEGs

## Gene ontology

:::
::: {.column}

![](assets/db-go.png)

- Network graph, loosely hierarchical
- Disjoint graphs
  - Biological process (Neutrophil Chemotaxis, Cell proliferation)
  - Molecular Function (Histone acetylation, Phosphorylation)
  - Cellular compartment (Nucleus, Cytoplasm, Plasma membrane)
- Genes can belong to multiple terms

- Fewer and smaller ontology
- Better curated
- Metabolic pathways

## Overrepresentation analysis (ORA/GSA)

![](assets/ora.png)

- Hypergeometric test (Fisher's exact test)

## Overrepresentation analysis (ORA/GSA)

- Background can be all genes or all genes expressed in your cell population
- Requires arbitrary cut-off
- Omits actual gene-level statistics
- Computationally fast
- Generally works for few genes with strong effects

## Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)

## Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

![](assets/gsea_image009.jpg)

:::
::: {.column}

- Enrichment score (ES)
- Normalized enrichment score (NES)
- No need for cut-offs
- Takes gene-level stats into account
- More sensitive to subtle changes

## Considerations

- Bias in gene sets
- Multifunctional genes, set size
- Well studied topics/diseases will be overrepresented (eg. covid)
- Translation of gene ids
- Changes in database
- Incomplete information for your organism
- Critical evaluation is required
